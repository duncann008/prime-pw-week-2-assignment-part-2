// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We set a variable called name and defined it as 'Dane'.
// Then we check if name is strictly equal to 'Mary'.
// If so, it says 'Hi, Mary!', and if not; 'How do you do?'
//

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// The variable 'secret' was created without definition, then code was created with a value of 123.
// If the code is strictly equal to 123, then secret will be assigned as super and the code will be doubled to 246.
// If the code is greater than 250, secret will be assigned as duper.
// In this case, the console should show: "super"

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// The first steps were creating 3 variables: isStudent, age, and zip, then defining them as true, 34, and 55407.
// The first conditional asks if isStudent is strictly true and zip is greater than 80000.
// The console will show "You're a student on the west coast!" if that is the case.
// The second conditional asks if isStudent is strictly false or younger than 30.
// If that is the case, the console will show "What are your hobbies?"
// The third conditional asks if isStudent is strictly true, and if that is the case the console will show "Welcome to Prime!"
// The final conditional says that if none of the original 3 came to fruition, then the console will say "How about the weather?"

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red'; // This variable is set to 'red', but should be 'blue'
let colorTwo = 'blue'; // This variable is set to 'blue', but should be 'red'
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
//colorTwo = 'purple';  Need to add this on this line to make sure colorTwo is also set to purple if mix is true.
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) { // || is an OR operator, not an AND operator.  In this instance, we want &&
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) { // Technically this is checking if minAge is less than or equal to age.  We want if(age >= minAge)
  console.log('no entry'); // This should be what happens when the condition is true, between the parentheses should be 'enter'
} else { // The else line with the console.log does not need to be here, as the description does not call for it.
  console.log('enter');
